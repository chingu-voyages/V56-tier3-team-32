## Overview

The Surgery Center Status Board is a web application that enables surgical center staff to manage and track patient surgery progress. The application provides different interfaces for Admins, Surgical Team Members, and Guests. Admins enter patient information, Surgical Team Members update surgery statuses, and Guests can view anonymized status updates from the waiting area. The system improves operational visibility, reduces anxiety for waiting families, and ensures status updates are compliant with privacy regulations.

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

#### Node.js & Package Manager
- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: Version 8.0.0 or higher (or **yarn**: Version 1.22.0 or higher)

#### Database

The project uses [MongoDb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database). To set up the database:
1) Log in to MongoDb Atlas
2) Create a Cluster and the database
3) Create two users: one with read and write access. The other with readonly access.
4) Get connection strings for both users (will be used in environmental variables).

#### Authentication/Authorization

The project uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

To set it up:
1) Log in to Clerk.
2) Setup a project.
3) Get the public and private keys (used in environmental variables).

#### AI

The project uses Gemini API as a chatbot.

To set it up: Follow [this guide](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get the API key (it will be used as an environmental variable).

#### Environment Variables

You can store env variables in your computer, or inside `.env` files.

##### Backend

Do not expose the following variables in code or other place accessible for foreign entities:

- **`CLERK_SECRET_KEY`**: private key provided by Clerk allowing your backend server to validate JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) issued by Clerk.
- **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: Credentials for accesing Gemini API chatbot.
- **`SURGERY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS`**: User credentials with Read/write access, pointing to a MongoDb database. Example: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster_address/database_name.
- **`SURGERY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_READONLY_CREDENTIALS`**: User credentials with readonly access, pointing to a MongoDb database. Used for AI to make on readonly queries on the spot.

##### Frontend

- **`REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`**: Clerk key used to enable frontend authentication.
- **`REACT_APP_BASE_URL`**: URL pointing to your backend service address.
