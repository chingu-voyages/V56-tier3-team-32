## Overview

The Surgery Center Status Board is a web application that enables surgical center staff to manage and track patient surgery progress. The application provides different interfaces for Admins, Surgical Team Members, and Guests. Admins enter patient information, Surgical Team Members update surgery statuses, and Guests can view anonymized status updates from the waiting area.
